 application and use case.

## Running the Bookinfo Sample Application

1. Bring up the [control plane](/docs/kubernetes-integration-control-plane.html#deploy)

1. Bring up the application containers:

   ```bash
   $ kubectl create -f examples/k8s-bookinfo.yaml
   ```

   The above command automatically launches the gateway service and the bookinfo application microservices.
   ![Bookinfo app](/docs/figures/amalgam8-example-app-bookinfo.svg)
   Each microservice has a corresponding Kubernetes service associated with it.
   Except for the *reviews* microservice, all other microservices are backed by a single pod.
   The *reviews* microservice has three backing pods, each implementing a different version of the service.

   Confirm that all services and pods are correctly defined and running:

   ```bash
   $ kubectl get services
   NAME          CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
   details       None            <none>        9080/TCP         1m
   gateway       10.102.224.69   <nodes>       6379:32000/TCP   1m
   kubernetes    10.96.0.1       <none>        443/TCP          22d
   productpage   None            <none>        9080/TCP         1m
   ratings       None            <none>        9080/TCP         1m
   reviews       None            <none>        9080/TCP         1m
   ```

   and

   ```bash
   $ kubectl get pods
   NAME                   READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   details-v1-w16wg       1/1       Running   0          1m
   gateway-j6vr6          1/1       Running   0          1m
   productpage-v1-chmvt   2/2       Running   0          1m
   ratings-v1-2p06t       1/1       Running   0          1m
   reviews-v1-v39cg       1/1       Running   0          1m
   reviews-v2-3xk9f       2/2       Running   0          1m
   reviews-v3-kcwpp       2/2       Running   0          1m
   rules-56tf8            1/1       Running   0          18h
   ```


1. Expose the Gateway service

   Determine the node on which the `gateway` pod runs, and use the node's IP address as the external gateway IP.

   ```bash
   $ kubectl describe pod gateway-j6vr6 | grep Node
   Node:		node4.k8s.example.com/9.147.221.77
   $ export GATEWAY_URL=9.147.221.77:32000
   ```

### Content Based Routing

1. Set the default routes to v1 of each service

   ```bash
   $ kubectl create -f examples/k8s-bookinfo-default-routes.yaml
   routingrule "set-productpage-v1" created
   routingrule "set-details-v1" created
   routingrule "set-ratings-v1" created
   routingrule "set-reviews-v1" created
   ```

   You can confirm the routes are defined and valid by inspecting the rules' `Status` field returned in:

   ```bash
   $ kubectl get routingrules -o json
   ```

   If you open the Bookinfo URL (`http://$GATEWAY_URL/productpage/productpage`) in your browser,
   you should see the bookinfo application `productpage` displayed. Notice that the `productpage`
   is displayed, with no rating stars since `reviews:v1` does not access the ratings service.

1. Route a specific user to `reviews:v2`

   Lets enable the ratings service for test user "jason" by routing productpage traffic to
   `reviews:v2` instances.

   ```bash
   $ kubectl create -f examples/k8s-bookinfo-jason-reviews-v2-route-rules.yaml
   routingrule "set-reviews-v2-user-jason" created
   ```

   Confirm the rule is applied and valid:

   ```bash
   $ kubectl get routingrule set-reviews-v2-user-jason -o json
   {
      "apiVersion": "amalgam8.io/v1",
      "kind": "RoutingRule",
      ...
      "status": {
         "state": "valid"
      }
   }
   ```

   Log in as user "jason" at the `productpage` web page. You should now see ratings (1-5 stars) next
   to each review.

### Resiliency Testing

   To test our bookinfo application microservices for resiliency, we will _inject a 7s delay_
   between the reviews:v2 and ratings microservices. Since the _reviews:v2_ service has a
   10s timeout for its calls to the ratings service, we expect the end-to-end flow to
   continue without any errors.

1. Inject the delay

   Create a fault injection, to delay traffic coming from user "jason" (our test user).

   ```bash
   $ kubectl create -f examples/k8s-bookinfo-jason-7s-delay.yaml
   routingrule "set-delay-user-jason" created
   ```

   Verify that the rule has been set:

   ```bash
   $ kubectl get routingrule set-delay-user-jason -o json | sed -n '/status/,/}/p'
      "status": {
         "state": "valid"
      }
   ```

1. Confirm application behavior

   If the application's front page was set to correctly handle delays, we expect it
   to load within approximately 7 seconds. To see the web page response times, open the
   *Developer Tools* menu in IE, Chrome or Firefox (typically, key combination _Ctrl+Shift+I_
   or _Alt+Cmd+I_) and reload the `productpage` web page.

   You will see that the webpage loads in about 6 seconds. The reviews section will show
   *Sorry, product reviews are currently unavailable for this book*.

    > Notice that we are restricting the failure impact to user "jason only. If you login
    > as any other user, you would not experience any delays.

1. Fixing failures by shifting to a new version

   In an ideal world, first all traffic would be shifted to the current released version: `reviews:v1`,
   followed by a gradual shift to a fixed version once it is available.
   Gradual traffic shifting has been demonstrated in the [helloworld](/docs/kubernetes-integration-helloworld.html#version-aware-routing)
   application, so we take a shortcut and set all traffic to flow to `reviews:v3` (while leaving the
   fault injection rule active):

   ```bash
   $ kubectl delete -f examples/k8s-bookinfo-jason-reviews-v2-route-rules.yaml
   routingrule "set-reviews-v2-user-jason" deleted
   $ kubectl create -f examples/k8s-bookinfo-jason-reviews-v3-route-rules.yaml
   routingrule "set-reviews-v3-user-jason" created
   $ kubectl get routingrule set-reviews-v3-user-jason -o json | sed -n '/status/,/}/p'
       "status": {
           "state": "valid"
       }
   ```

   Reloading the application should now display the main bookinfo page with a few seconds delay and
   book ratings should be displayed using red stars.

### Cleanup

1. Delete the routing rules

   ```bash
   $ kubectl delete -f examples/k8s-bookinfo-default-route-rules.yaml
   $ kubectl delete -f testing/test-scripts/bookinfo-jason-7s-delay.yaml
   $ kubectl delete -f examples/k8s-bookinfo-jason-reviews-v3-route-rules.yaml
   $ kubectl get routingrules    #-- there should be no more routing rules
   No resources found.
   ```

1. Terminate the application pods

   ```bash
   $ kubectl delete -f examples/k8s-bookinfo.yaml
   ```

1. Terminate the [control plane](/docs/kubernetes-integration-control-plane.html#cleanup)
